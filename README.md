AF-ScriptPack
=============

A collection of scripts to collect data for AppFirst from various sources.

check_snr
---------
The check_snr.pl script queries a router running DD-WRT for IP addresses, associated MAC addresses and signal strength. It then outputs these as a total number of addresses, with key/value paired listing of IP=SNR.

This code is hackery, and not particularly good at that. Use at your own risk. If you find it useful and improve the code, please request to merge. If you are aware of other tools that do this better, faster and cheaper - I'm happy to migrate: I just haven't found anything.
